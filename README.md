# Pathfinder
A visualizer for various pathfinding algorithms.

## A*
### Introduction
The A* Search algorithm is one of the most popular algorithms used in path-finding and graph traversals.

# TO-DO
- [ ] Refactor code into separate functions and modules
- [ ] Add ability to place walls (mouse and 'a' 's' keys), replay same grid (spacebar), reset to new grid ('r' key) 
- [ ] Implement different heuristics
- [ ] Extend to other pathfinding algorithms
- [ ] Add 'heatmap'
